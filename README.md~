Tenant Management Communication was an app built in 2011 with a team of 5 developers for Berkeley's CS160 (User Interface Design) course. The purpose of the app is to standardize and speed up the communication process of tenants reporting issues within the apartment, management receiving the reports, and finally sending someone over to deal with it. The app offers a reporting view for tenants and a management view which allows managers to better track, sort, and organize reports from tenants.
